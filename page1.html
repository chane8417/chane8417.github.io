    <h2>The story of Marley & Me begins when...</h2>
    <p>John and Jenny Grogan, two newly weds, decide to move to Florida to start a new life. They successfully find a good house and suitable jobs as newspaper reporters. When Jenny mentions to John that she wants to have children, John follows his friend's, Sebastian Tunney's, advice, and takes Jenny to pick a dog. Jenny picks the runt of the litter, a yellow labrador retriever, who they named Marley after the singer Bob Marley. (See videos 1 & 2 on the video tab)</p>
    <p>Marley, from the beginning, was not a calm and obedient dog. He stole food regularly, tore up the garage when left alone, jumps on people (see video 4 on the video tab), and absolutely refuses to obey commands. As time went on, Marley was getting on Jenny's nerves more and more, but unlike Jenny, John, who was already running out of material to write about in his newspaper, started writing about Marley's adventures. (See video 3 on the video tab)</p>
    <p>Soon, Jenny became pregnant. Unfortunately, she loses the baby, prompting her and John to go on a short vacation to Ireland. However, when Jenny gets pregnant again, she gives birth to a boy, who they named Patrick. A couple of years later, she gives birth to another boy, Conner, and after another few years, a girl, Colleen. They moved once more because of rising crime rates to a neighborhood called Boca Raton, then again to a farm in rural Pennyslvania. John gets a new job that he enjoys. Jenny stops working and stays home to take care of her children. And Marley continues doing what he always does.</p>
    <p>Until Marley, who has begun to get old, shows signs of arthritis and deafness, and an attack of gastric dilatation volvulus, but luckily he survives.</p>
